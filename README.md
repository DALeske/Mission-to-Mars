# Challenge 10: Mission-to-Mars

## Objective
In preparation for pursuing a career at NASA, Robin is trying to take in as much information about Mars as she can. She would like her application to stand out, so she has created a website with Mars information that not only highlights her skills as a data scientist, but demonstrates her interest in all things space.

## Methods
Using Beautiful Soup and Splinter for web scraping, Robin has extracted online Mars data and image links and has transferred that data to a MongoDB database. She then created a website with the data and images using Flask and Bootstrap. The result is a stunning website that is both entertaining and informative, at least to those interested in applying for a career at NASA.
